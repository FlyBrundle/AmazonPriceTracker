TODO: Add argv options for url.

## Purpose
As someone who enjoys selling used game systems and pop culture memoribilia online, it's signficantly important to know when a website has a product in stock and at what price. Simply visiting that website every so often isn't sufficient, as manually traveling to a url is subject to being slower or more disorganized than an automated process.

In a desire to experiment with Beautiful Soup, I created this to expedite research needed for product re-stocks and prices. It currently draws information from Amazon.com, and for specifically one product at a time. It's expandable to be used for multiple websites, inventory control, and even implementation with Flask. 

## How to run
* Download the script
* Run AmazonPriceTracker.py, no system arguments
* Email settings currently must be modified through the main() function
